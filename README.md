# flip_everest

Flutter Cross-Platform Webview Application made for a client, with custom Splash Screen, App Logo, and OneSignal Push Notifications, configured to trigger on Wordpress Site Update.

The [Original Website](https://flipeverest.com/) has been converted to a Flutter Webview Application. The UI consists of:

1. A Native Splash Screen
2. `WebViewAppPage` WebView Screen, which loads the web app that the application has been made for.
3. `LoadingScreen` Loading Screen, to be shown while the WebView loads.

A OneSignal Notification Handler `NotificationHandler` is also provided, which handles the push notifications sent from OneSignal.
